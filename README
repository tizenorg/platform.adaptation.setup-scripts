Some coding style notes for the shell scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Do not use bashisms, install 'dash' and use it to verify that the
   scripts are free of bashisms.

2. Do not use all capitals for variables

3. For shared files, prefix all symbols which are not supposed to be
   used from outside with "__".

4. Be consistent with my style. If you see that something makes no sense
   or could be improved, change that globally.

5. All the error and verbose output should go to stderr

6. Use -- to separate options and arguments, this is generally a good defensive
   programming practice to make sure no one tricks your commands by adding
   options to what should be arguments. E.g., 'rm $file' can be made 'rm -rf /"
   if one makes "$file" to be "-rf /" somehow. 'rm -- $file' would catch this.
